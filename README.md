# SEO Scraper like Screaming Frog {beta}
Tool for analysing a webpage's structure

## Takes URL and Domain as Input
- url: "www.kulturdata.de"
- domain: "kulturdata.de"
(Why? To distinguish between internal and external links. Drops external links)

## Exports Data as CSV file
- "seo-graph.csv" for further visualization with gephi
- "seo.csv" contains the seo data
- "seo.log" just for debugging purposes
